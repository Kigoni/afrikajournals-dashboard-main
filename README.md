# Message to Backend Developer

Hi [Dev‚Äôs Name],

The frontend dashboard has been fully Dockerized and pushed to GitHub.

**Important note:**  
Only the `Submit Journal` page is currently using an actual API endpoint. The rest of the application (journal listings, search filters, analytics, etc.) is relying on mock data.

To proceed with full integration, we need the following API endpoints:

- Journals list (GET)
- Journal details by ID (GET)
- Advanced search and filters (GET/POST)
- Analytics/metrics data (GET)
- Indexing, language, disciplines, and country data (GET)

Let me know when those are available or if you need example payloads.

Thanks!  
‚Äî Michael
